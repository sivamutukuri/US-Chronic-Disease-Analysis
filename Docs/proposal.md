## Background 

* The CDC's Division of Population Health has created a standardized set of 124 indicators that states, territories, and large metropolitan areas can use to collect and report chronic 
  disease data. These indicators were developed through consensus and are important for public health practice.

## Objective

* The primary purpose of this dataset appears to be monitoring and analyzing trends related to chronic diseases in the United States.

## Research questions

* Trends in Chronic Disease Prevalence: What are the trends in the prevalence of chronic diseases over the years covered by the dataset? Are certain chronic diseases becoming more or 
  less common?

* Geographical Variations: Are there significant geographical variations in the prevalence of specific chronic diseases or health outcomes? Do certain regions have higher or lower rates of 
  chronic conditions?

* Temporal Changes: Have there been significant changes in the rates of chronic diseases over the years in different locations? Are there any notable patterns or fluctuations?

* Health Disparities: Do health disparities exist among different demographic groups (stratification categories)? For example, do certain age groups, genders, or racial/ethnic groups have 
  higher rates of chronic diseases?

* Mortality Trends: Are there trends in mortality rates related to specific chronic diseases? Have mortality rates improved or worsened over time?
